# tylernix.me

My personal website that I designed using [Figma](https://figma.com), built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), and host using [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

## Visit

[https://tylernix.me/](https://tylernix.me/)

## Why

I wanted to play with Next.js's [Static Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) feature using Markdown files as the data source.

My blog posts are stored in `/_posts` as Markdown files. Super simple. I try to treat this website kind of like a [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) for my most recent curiosities.

I also wanted to get better at building my own designs. I sketch (most) ideas for this website before I write any code using [Figma](https://figma.com).

## How to create your own

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example blog-starter blog-starter-app
# or
yarn create next-app --example blog-starter blog-starter-app
```

Your blog should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)! If it doesn't work, post on [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions).

Deploy it to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/import?filter=next.js&utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).

# Notes

This blog-starter uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). To control the generated stylesheet's filesize, this example uses Tailwind CSS' v1.4 [`purge` option](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/controlling-file-size/#removing-unused-css) to remove unused CSS.
